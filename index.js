    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. if the this keyword is not called or nested then it will refer to the window as a global object.
    2.imlplicit binding is where if your using a method on an object whatever is left of the dot will get the this keyword.
    3. with constructors we use the new keyword to create a new object
    4. explicit binding you can point to another object depending on which keyword you use (call apply)
